<h2 align="center">To-do list as for now</h2>
<ul>
 
<li> ðŸ—™	Implement shopkeeper logics and randomly spawned shops  </li>
<li> âœ” Implement damsel </li>
<li> âœ” Implement caveman </li>
<li> ðŸ—™ Implement skeleton </li>
<li> ðŸ—™ Implement arrow trap </li>
<li> âœ” Fix rope logics - if thrown, when it touches bottom of some tile above it or it reaches its maximum travel distance of 8 tiles up, then it should expand to the bottom. Now it's the opposite - it expands as it travels upwards. </li>
<li> âœ” Implement cape and jetpack </li>
<li> ðŸ—™ Putting project on Travis </li>
<li> âœ” Implement 4 layers system - top one for the console and HUD, bottom one for tilemap and the rest for other sprites </li>
<li> ðŸ—™ Tune-up the level generator; make it more random; add random events like snake well </li>
<li> ðŸ—™ Implement music using streaming from filesystem - I elaborated a bit on this on my blog: https://dbeef.wordpress.com/2018/05/24/some-words-on-developing-spelunkyds/ </li> 
 
</ul>
 
 Obviously I omit things like implement Olmec or implement lava city - let's finish cave level first.

<h2 align="center"> Building </h2>

<p> 1) Download devkitPro for your platform from their official website: https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started </p>
<p> 2) Set up a few environment variables, as shown in their tutorial  </p>
<p> 3) cd to the spelunky-ds directory and type 'make'  </p>

<h2 align="center"> Running </h2>
<p> For running on a PC I preffer an emulator called Desmume. type 'desmume spelunky.nds' for running. </p>
<p> For running on an NDS I use 'R4i-3DS-RTS-WiFi' (oh boy) card, but it's probably going to work on any other card. Just make sure, you have NDS program called 'moonshell', which helps running homebrew.

<h2 align="center"> Tools I use </h2>
<ul>
  <li> C++ </li>
  <li> GNU Make </li>
  <li> libnds - as included with devkitPro toolchain https://devkitpro.org/ </li>
  <li> mappy - https://tilemap.co.uk/mappy.php </li>
  <li> desmume emulator </li>
  <li> R4 card for testing on a real Nintendo </li>
  <li> gimp, for converting to 256 color (8bit) indexed bmp/png </li>
  <li> a real Spelunky code for inspiration ofcourse, distributed by Derek Yu on this address: http://www.derekyu.com/games/spelunky_1_1_src.zip </li>
  <li> Spelunky assets, I take them from the Spelunky Community Update Project because there's no need for installing Game Maker: https://github.com/tyrovc/SpelunkyCommunityUpdateProject </li>
  <li> CLion for editing </li>
</ul>
