**********************************************************************

<*> TODO LIST:

TODO MEMORY OPTIMIZATION: Adressing and disposing sprites on the fly:
when ie. bomb explodes, all sprites with OAM_ID higher than the bomb's id, got to be readress to the left side of
the memory bank, to fill the blank space,
main character sprite has its own sprite on the lower screen only when it is there, if not, no sprite is
created for the lower screen

TODO Rope: reuse bomb code, when thrown, go up with certain speed untill bottom collision or
max height (8 x 16 px) is reached.
If so, change image to the finished image.
Every reached tile, add new rope sprite on that place (it is 16x8 px in the original, but we will have it 16x16,
because of the limit of 128 sprites per engine).

TODO Ability of picking up already thrown bombs
