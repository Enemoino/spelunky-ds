Vanilla NintendoDS has only 4 MB of RAM - declaring all of these variables is probably a few hundred bytes and will
be even more when we will have more maps.

What is to be done is moving all these maps to filesystem, so the program would read them only when they're needed
(level generation) and then release resources.

It's probably not a huge problem, just an idea for future patches.
