When making an icon in gimp, remember it to be specifically:

> 32 px x 32 px
> 72ppi x 72ppi
> .bmp
> of 16 colours, first colour of bitmap would be transparent when rendered, so set it as first in "colors->map->rearrange map"
> when saving, you MUST check the "compatibility options " ->  "do not write color space information"
